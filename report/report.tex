\title{Software Reliability}
\author{Finlay Curran, Jaime Lennox, Ben Lindsey}

% Topics that matter are:
% 1. Data structures and their initialisation
% 2. Neighbour management
% 3. Recomputation, and convergence to shortest paths (mydist message handling)
% 4. Detecting failures and repairs using failure detectors (open and closed
% message handling)
%
% Follow the experimental design outlined in Â§A and use one of the provided
% topologies to produce at least one graph with your implementation.

\begin{document}
\maketitle

The report should focus on:
\begin{itemize}
\item  Describing strategies you implemented to enable bug-finding and verification, and how you combined
these strategies into an overall tool.
\item Describing how you went about evaluating the effectiveness of your strategies, and any activities you
undertook to check the correct operation of your tool.
\item Describing any aspects of your design that you regard as noteworthy (e.g., if you deliberately deviated
from the techniques described in the lectures because you could see opportunities for improved speed of
verification and/or ease of implementation).
\end{itemize}
Marks for the report will be awarded primarily for good ideas and insights, and evidence of a thorough
evaluation of your tool. Some marks will also be reserved for the quality of writing and presentation.
